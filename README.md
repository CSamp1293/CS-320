## _How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?_
To ensure my code is functional, running frequently and often is key. In this specific scenario, running JUnit tests frequently and often ensured functionality of required features. From a security standpoint, utilizing certain libraries in JavaScript helped to protect sensitive inforamtion entered such as a users address or phone number. Specifically, using the ArrayList library, privately and securely stores a contact entries information in a list.

## _How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?_
Interpreting user needs can be difficult. However, I find that using certain methods such as user interviews or usability testing can help determine what a user is looking for in a product. Gathering this information in turning it into documentation can help get the ball rolling on product development. 

## _How do I approach designing software?_
I approach software designing from a curosity perspective. By being curious, you can obtain needed information to help build a stakeholders vision. Often times, someone may not know their true vision, so it is crucial to throw out ideas for their vision and build upon what was started with as a cohesive group effort. This is a common requirements technique called elicitation.
